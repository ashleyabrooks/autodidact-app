## Hello, Autodidact!

Autodidact is a platform to help users organize their self-learning curricula. The app is architected using a client-server model: a Flask-Python API on the backend and a React-powered front end. Users can create topics, collect links to articles, videos, books, and websites, and then organize the content into an drag-and-droppable, ordered curriculum that works best for their learning style. Users can mark the content items as complete and view a data visualization of their progress.

## Technologies

React, Flask, Python, Javascript, ES6, AJAX, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL

## About Me

Iâ€™m a hyper-creative and empathic software engineer with two years of experience as a technical product manager.

While I spent my days managing software engineers at a creative agency, in the evenings I taught myself new skills like programming to better understand the engineering problems my team was running into. I decided to pursue my deep curiosity in software engineering after realizing that I was more fascinated by how the engineers on my team were implementing features rather than what features they were building. 

I built Autodidact during my time at Hackbright Academy, the top women's only software engineering school in the Bay Area. I used this project as an opportunity to teach myself React. I plan to continue working on this app by optimizing the code and adding new features like API security, ChartJS progress visualization, and potentially even building a Javascript Chrome Extension. 

There is so much to learn in the field and I can't wait to explore it as a full-time software engineer. If you like my project, feel free to say hi at helloashleybrooks@gmail.com.
